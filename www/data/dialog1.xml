    <description>The local branch of the Hudson Franklin Bank is under attack. Our hacker is using four attack towers located around the city in an attempt to gain access to financial records.

Take out the attacking towers by selecting them and then correctly answering the questions. All four towers must be taken offline before the bank's defenses are depleted.

Good Luck!

    <levelSuccess>Congratulations, you have successfully protected the bank's records.

Unfortunately the hacker was able to escape before being apprehended and we have evidence that he is already making plans for his next attack.

There is no time for celebration, we must locate and stop the hacker from making another attack.

Nice work!

    <levelFailure>You have failed to protect the bank's records.

The hacker was able to penetrate the network and steal the personal information of thousands of customers. The bank appreciates your efforts but they are now forced to reimburse customers of their losses and make costly improvements to their network defenses.

There is no time to rest however, you should improve your skills and prepare yourself.
